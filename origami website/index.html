    <h1 style="color: darkblue;">Origami</h1>
    
    <p>Origami is the art of paper folding, 
        which is often associated with Japanese 
        culture. In modern usage, the word "origami" 
        is used as an inclusive term for all folding 
        practices, regardless of their culture of origin.The goal is to transform a flat square 
        sheet of paper into a finished sculpture through folding and sculpting techniques. 
        Modern origami practitioners generally discourage the use of cuts, glue, or markings 
        on the paper. Origami folders often use the Japanese word kirigami to refer to designs 
        which use cuts.

        The small number of basic origami folds can be 
        combined in a variety of ways to make intricate designs. 
        The best-known origami model is the Japanese paper crane. 
        In general, these designs begin with a square sheet of 
        paper whose sides may be of different colors, prints, or patterns. 
        Traditional Japanese origami, which has been practiced since the Edo period (1603–1867), 
        has often been less strict about these conventions, sometimes cutting the paper or using 
        nonsquare shapes to start with. The principles of origami are also used in stents, packaging, 
        and other engineering applications.</p>
